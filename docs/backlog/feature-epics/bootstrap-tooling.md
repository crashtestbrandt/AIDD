**Title:** Bootstrap tooling
**Summary:** Establish bootstrap assets that seed new or existing projects with AIDD prompts and guidance.

## Architecture Overview

* C4 Model links: Not applicable for documentation-focused bootstrap assets.
* ADR references: None yet; bootstrap documentation does not introduce architectural changes.
* Architecture conformance notes: Aligns with the baseline AIDD repository structure defined in the root documentation.

## Objectives

* Provide canonical bootstrap prompts for greenfield and brownfield adoption.
* Enable consistent kickoff workflows for teams adopting AIDD.
* Reduce ramp-up time by centralizing guidance for AI + human collaborators.

## Stories

* [ ] [STORY-BT-001](../stories/bootstrap-prompts.md) â€” Bootstrap prompts

## Definition of Done (DoD)

* All Stories complete and merged with review approval.
* Documentation and supporting assets published with clear traceability to the Epic.
* Any supporting templates or prompts versioned and discoverable from the repo root.
* Rollback or archival plan documented for deprecated bootstrap assets.
