# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
<Short, descriptive title>

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX

> Include date and decision owner; keep ADRs immutable after “Accepted” (create a new ADR to change course).

## Context
- What problem are we solving?
- What constraints or forces shape the decision?
- Background, related epics/stories/incidents.

## Decision
- The decision we made.
- Include diagrams, snippets, or contracts if relevant.

> If contracts change, link exact versions (e.g., OpenAPI commit hash) and deprecation policy. Note any backward/forward compatibility guarantees.

## Rationale
- Why this decision?
- Alternatives considered and why not chosen.
- Tradeoffs or risks accepted.

## Consequences
- Positive outcomes (enablers, simplifications).
- Negative outcomes (risks, complexity, migration costs).
- Future considerations (when to revisit?).

## References
- Links to related ADRs, epics, stories, contracts.
- External references (RFCs, docs, benchmarks).
